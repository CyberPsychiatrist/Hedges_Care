- **Species Identification**: Database of 1000+ plant species from global datasets
- **Health Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of plant vitality and growth conditions
- **Expert Recommendations**: Science-backed landscaping advice tailored to specific plant types

### Plant Library
A comprehensive database containing detailed information about various plant species, including:

```typescript
interface PlantData {
  id: string;
  species_name: string;
  common_name: string;
  plant_type: string; // 'tree', 'flower', 'shrub', etc.
  description: string;
  environmental_benefits: string;
  landscaping_tips: string;
  co2_absorption: {
    daily: number;
    annual: number;
    impact: string;
  };
  growth_conditions: {
    height_m: number;
    canopy_m2: number;
    optimal_temp: number;
    rainfall_mm: number;
    soil_type: string;
  };
  confidence: number;
}
```

**Sample Plants in Database:**
- **Mango Tree (Mangifera indica)**: 52.5 kg CO2/year absorption

## NFT Integration

### Plant NFT Concept
Convert verified plant analysis into unique NFTs representing their environmental impact and providing digital ownership of verified plant species.

**NFT Structure:**
```typescript
interface PlantNFT {
  id: string;
  tokenId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  speciesName: string;
  commonName: string;
  plantType: string;
  environmentalImpact: {
    co2AbsorbedAnnual: number;
    co2AbsorbedDaily: number;
    canopyArea: number;
    height: number;
    location: string;
  };
  metadata: {
    confidence: number;
    scanDate: string;
    optimalTemp: number;
    rainfall: number;
    soilType: string;
    healthScore: number;
    rarity: 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'epic' | 'legendary';
  };
  ownership: {
    ownerAddress: string;
    creatorAddress: string;
    mintDate: string;
    lastTransferDate?: string;
  };
  blockchain: {
    contractAddress: string;
    chainId: string;
    transactionHash: string;
    blockNumber: number;
  };
  marketData?: {
    currentPrice?: number;
    currency?: string;
    listedForSale?: boolean;
    lastSalePrice?: number;
    lastSaleDate?: string;
  };
}
```

### Rarity System
NFT rarity is determined by CO2 absorption capacity:
- **Legendary**: ≥ 60 kg CO2/year
- **Epic**: 45-59 kg CO2/year
- **Rare**: 35-44 kg CO2/year
- **Uncommon**: 25-34 kg CO2/year
- **Common**: < 25 kg CO2/year

### NFT Marketplace Features
- **Buy/Sell Trading Platform**: Users can buy, sell, and trade plant NFTs
- **Portfolio Management**: Track NFT collection and value
- **Environmental Impact Tracking**: Monitor CO2 contributions through NFT holdings
- **Provenance Verification**: Blockchain-based verification of plant analysis data

### Minting Process
1. User uploads plant image for analysis
2. AI completes plant identification and environmental impact assessment
3. User can choose to mint the analysis as an NFT
4. NFT is created with environmental impact metadata
5. NFT can be traded on the marketplace

## CO2 Measurement & Environmental Impact

### Scientific CO2 Absorption Algorithm
The platform uses a scientifically-backed algorithm to calculate CO2 absorption:

```typescript
function calculateCO2Absorption(plant: PlantCO2Data): {
  daily: number; // kg CO2 per day
  annual: number; // kg CO2 per year
  impact: string; // Environmental impact description
} {
  // Base absorption rates by species (kg CO2/m²/year)
  const speciesRates: Record<string, number> = {
    'oak': 22.0,
    'pine': 12.5,
    'maple': 21.0,
    'hedge': 15.8,
    'fruit_tree': 18.2
  };
  
  const baseRate = speciesRates[plant.species] || 15.0;
  const healthMultiplier = plant.healthScore;
  const areaMultiplier = plant.leafArea;
  
  const annualAbsorption = baseRate * healthMultiplier * areaMultiplier;
  const dailyAbsorption = annualAbsorption / 365;
  
  return {
    daily: dailyAbsorption,
    annual: annualAbsorption,
    impact: generateImpactDescription(annualAbsorption)
  };
}
```

### Environmental Impact Tracking
