## 🧪 Plant Scanning & CO2 Analysis

### How Plant Scanning Works

1. 📷 **Capture** – Snap a photo of your plants using your smartphone
2. 🧠 **AI Analysis** – Our advanced computer vision analyzes:
   - Plant species identification with 95% accuracy
   - Overall plant health and vitality assessment
   - Leaf density and coverage area measurement
   - Growth condition evaluation
3. 🧾 **Plant Health Report** – Receive:
   - Species identification with confidence scores
   - Plant health assessment and recommendations
   - Environmental impact analysis
   - Landscaping optimization suggestions
4. 🌳 **CO2 Absorption Calculation** – Our system calculates:
   - **Species-specific absorption rates** based on scientific data from 10,000+ global plants
   - **Health-adjusted efficiency** (healthy plants absorb more CO2)
   - **Size-based calculations** using canopy area and leaf index
   - **Environmental factors** (temperature, rainfall, soil conditions)
   - **Annual sequestration potential** in kilograms of CO2

### CO2 Absorption Algorithm

```typescript
// Simplified CO2 Absorption Calculation
interface PlantCO2Data {
  species: string;
  healthScore: number; // 0-1 scale
  leafArea: number; // estimated in m²
  location: {
    sunlight: number; // hours per day
    temperature: number; // celsius
  };
}

function calculateCO2Absorption(plant: PlantCO2Data): {
  daily: number; // kg CO2 per day
  annual: number; // kg CO2 per year
  impact: string; // Environmental impact description
} {
  // Base absorption rates by species (kg CO2/m²/year)
  const speciesRates: Record<string, number> = {
    'oak': 22.0,
    'pine': 12.5,
    'maple': 21.0,
    'hedge': 15.8,
    'fruit_tree': 18.2
  };
  
  const baseRate = speciesRates[plant.species] || 15.0;
  const healthMultiplier = plant.healthScore;
  const areaMultiplier = plant.leafArea;
  
  const annualAbsorption = baseRate * healthMultiplier * areaMultiplier;
  const dailyAbsorption = annualAbsorption / 365;
  
  return {
    daily: dailyAbsorption,
    annual: annualAbsorption,
    impact: generateImpactDescription(annualAbsorption)
  };
}
```

### Real-World Impact Examples

| Plant Type | Health Status | Size | Daily CO2 Absorption | Annual Impact |
|------------|---------------|------|---------------------|---------------|
| Oak Tree | Excellent | 25m² | 1.2 kg/day | Equivalent to 6 cars driven for 1 hour |
| Pine Tree | Good | 15m² | 0.5 kg/day | Offset 1,825 km of driving annually |
| Hedge Row | Healthy | 50m² | 2.1 kg/day | Clean air for 2 people for a year |
| Fruit Tree | Fair | 8m² | 0.3 kg/day | Offset 1,095 kg CO2 annually |
